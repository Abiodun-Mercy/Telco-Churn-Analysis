# Telco-Churn-Analysis
This is a personal project done with Microsoft Power Bi.

During my 3 weeks bootcamp with Tech4Dev, this analysis was carried out to determine the churn rate of customers in telecommunication.

The dataset required little cleaning. This involved removing duplicates and some empty cells. I also used the DAX measure feature on Power Bi to calculate the total number of churned customers. Microsoft Power Bi was also used for the visualizations.

The analysis gives information on the number of customers who churned (i.e,changed their service providers) based on gender, online backup, internet service, payment method and so on. This analysis can help telecom companies know how well they are doing and also help them look into certain areas where they need to improve so as to retain their customers.
